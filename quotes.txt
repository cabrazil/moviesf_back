Fresh score.
It's a far from perfect film, but a richly entertaining one, with a twist that only devoted petrolheads will know is coming.

Fresh score.
It's still impeccably made, with Mangold distilling the story into two essential parts: the thrill of the game, and the thrill of watching people who are good at their jobs do their jobs.

Fresh score.
There's still lots to enjoy about the film, which provides us with two wonderful lead performances, exciting speed races, and car executives wearing some of the most beautifully tailored suits this side of Mad Men.
